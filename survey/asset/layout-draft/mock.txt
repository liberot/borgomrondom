"There must be some kind of way out of here," Said the joker to the thief
"There's too much confusion I can't get no relief.
Businessmen, they drink my wine Plowmen dig my earth, none of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
Abra-abra-cadabra i want to reach out and grab ya
Abra-abra-cadabra
Abracadabra
But I think more than I ought to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you
Now no one's knocked upon my door for a thousand years or more all made up and nowhere to go
Welcome to this one man show
There goes Moses carrying his bubble book
Never has a problem, just has a cup
It's good clean alcohol and it fills you up
And here I go laughing like a fool, yeah
I used to spend my sweet sunny days supping aways
Along came Forbiddy and he put me aways
Down at the station was kept for strays
And I went laughing, geez he like busting me, he liked busting me
